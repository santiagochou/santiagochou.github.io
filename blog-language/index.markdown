* Dynamic variable are useful **in circumstances(在...情况下)** where for example, you don't know the number of different variables your program might want to manipulate when you are writing it.  **In such circumstance**, you insert code into your program which creates (and destroys) variables on **an as-needed basis(视所需而定)**.  This often causes programmer great difficulty and it is **fair(合理的)** to say that it has been one of the reasons why people dislike C/C++ programming.  Programs create dynamic program variables by asking the operating system to **set aside(预留)** a portion of memory for their exclusive use. If the memory is available, the operating system marks this block of memory as being "in-use" and owned by the program concerned. Any other program which either **accidentally or maliciously (有意或无意的)** attempts to read or write to this block of memory without suitable **security clearance(安全检查)** will be prevented from doing so by the operating system and the computer processor's built-in (hardware) memory protection sub-system.

> [libxlsxwriter stands out as a gem](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44980928/how-to-interface-c-and-excel-output-from-c-program-to-an-excel-spreadsheet) : I would highly (as someone who has used the library extensively, and submitted patches to multiple versions of his Excel libraries) recommend xlsxwriter. It's intuitive, well-documented, and he provides similar APIs for numerous languages, with no usage restrictions. Especially in C++, libxlsxwriter stands out as a gem.
